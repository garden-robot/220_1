#Question 4, Part 2
#Psuedo!

#Unsure how to add arguments?

#Check first arg with if/else statement, either -s or -r

#if -s, check current file permissions
#grep through the saved permission file to extract old permissions
#echo the permissions in an organied list

#if -r, then iterate through loops to interpret the saved permissions
#change the saved permissions to binary operators
#apply the binary operators to the file with chmod
#echo that the change has been made

echo This is a psuedo code file, so it runs nothing!
